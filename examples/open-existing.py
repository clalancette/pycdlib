# This is a simple example program to show how to use PyCdlib to open up an
# existing ISO passed on the command-line, and print out all of the file names
# at the root of the ISO.

# Import standard python modules.
import sys

# Import pycdlib itself.
import pycdlib

# Check that there are enough command-line arguments.

# Open up a file object.  This causes PyCdlib to parse all of the metadata on the
# ISO, which is used for later manipulation.
iso.open(sys.argv[1])

# Now iterate through each of the files on the root of the ISO, printing out
# their names.

# everything about the previous ISO, and can be re-used.
