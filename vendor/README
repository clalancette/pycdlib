This directory contains vendored files stored in
Git-LFS (https://git-lfs.github.com/).  In particular:

- cdrkit-1.1.11-fedora40-patched.tar.gz
  A vendored version of cdrkit (and more specifically, genisoimage) used to
  run the tests.  We vendor this because the different versions of genisoimage
  actually put things in different places on the ISO, and this messes with the
  tests checking where things are in the ISO.  This doesn't mean that pycdlib
  can only open ISOs from genisoimage; it just means the tests expect that
  particular layout.  This file was created by downloading the cdrkit source
  RPM from koji (https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/cdrkit/1.1.11/54.fc40/src/cdrkit-1.1.11-54.fc40.src.rpm,
  though that URI may not exist anymore).  The package was then installed
  (rpm -ivh /path/to/*.src.rpm), and then the original source tarball with
  patches was prepared (rpmbuild -bp cdrkit.spec).  The "icedax" directory was
  then removed, as it is not required and needs additional dependencies.  It was
  then tarred back up.

  (rpm -ivh /path/to/*.src.rpm), and then the original source tarball was
  exploded (tar -xvf ~/rpmbuild/cdrkit-1.1.11.tar.gz), and then the patches
  from the source RPM were applied in order.  The "icedax" directory was also
  removed from CMakeLists.txt After all of that, it was tarred back up.
